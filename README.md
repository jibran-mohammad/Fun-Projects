# Fun-Projects
Some fun projects like snake game, Tic Tac Toe, stop watch etc.
These projects are created with documentations. If you want to learn how to create desktop GUI's in python, and learn python programming in general, this place is the 
great start. The projects arn't very difficult. You will also learn some of the third party libraries like pyqt5 and some inbuilt libraries like tkinter.
